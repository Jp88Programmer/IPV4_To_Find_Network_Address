# IPV4_To_Find_Network_Address
its repo very useful to find the ipv4 network address and broadcast address 
first as input of ip adress and its mask 
Example :  Enter an ip address : 130.100.130.78/28
here 130.100.130.78 --> ipv4 
and
subnet mask --> /28
which is 255.255.255.240 not writing in this type simpliy write maximum 1s bits number to identy as the mask 
ok well done your inputs has been done and run the program 
Few of second your output completed 
to show the network and broadcast address
to try and if any isue or bugs please give the feedback 
Thanks..
